Anatomy of the Human Heart:
The human heart is a muscular organ that pumps blood throughout the body. It is located in the chest, between the lungs, and behind the sternum. The heart has four chambers: two upper atria (left and right) and two lower ventricles (left and right). The right side of the heart receives deoxygenated blood from the body and pumps it to the lungs for oxygenation. The left side of the heart receives oxygenated blood from the lungs and pumps it to the rest of the body. Key structures include the aorta, pulmonary artery, vena cava, and various valves (tricuspid, mitral, aortic, pulmonary).

Common Cardiovascular Diseases:
Hypertension, also known as high blood pressure, is a common condition where the long-term force of the blood against your artery walls is high enough that it may eventually cause health problems, such as heart disease. Coronary artery disease involves damage to the heart's major blood vessels. Myocardial infarction, or heart attack, occurs when blood flow to a part of the heart is blocked. Treatment often involves lifestyle changes, medications (e.g., ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers), and sometimes surgical procedures like bypass surgery.
